Before using the configuration script, create the /etc/apache2/sites-plotty/
directory and then add:
    Include /etc/apache2/sites-plotty
to the VirtualHost (probably in /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default).

Then to install plotty for a user, mark init-plotty as executable and run
    ./init-plotty [username]

This will create a new plotty directory in username's home, with everything
contained below that. It will also dump the config into apache, and reload
apache config. In theory, then, once this script runs the url:
    http://server/plotty/username/
should load the pipeline.
