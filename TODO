== Short term ==
* Output div doesn't expand to contain a wide table ( http://bit.ly/j9e5c1 )
  * We can fix the table, but the real issue is the graph. Not much we can do
    about the graph on the client side. We could try some heuristics on the
    graph generation side to decide whether the SVG needs to be made wider,
    depending on the size of the input (number of bars, etc).
* We should be able to save, reuse and delete derived value columns (probably
  through a multiselect)
* Make sure value columns always appear if they're selected, even if there
  are no values for any row
  * This predicates on making sure DataTable.scenarioColumns and
    DataTable.valueColumns are updated accurately
* Add option to ignore or error on a failed float conversion when loading
  the original data (DataTypes.py:128)
* Add option to turn off the cross-product logic for graphs, and just produce
  a single graph
* Purge the graph cache, probably in the plotting code since the slowdown would
  barely be noticable there
* If a log file no longer exists, and we try to load a pipeline involving it,
  an AJAX error occurs
* gzip CSV files when they're created

== Other stuff ==
The filter block probably needs to be more flexible. As a first step it would
be helpful to toggle between "meets all these criteria" and "meets at least
one criteria" - that is between AND and OR relations.
