== Short term ==
* Output div doesn't expand to contain a wide table ( http://bit.ly/j9e5c1 )
* We should be able to save, reuse and delete derived value columns (probably
  through a multiselect)
* Trash the debug link, fix the new pipeline link on squirrel (should be
  <a href=".#" I think?)
* Make sure value columns always appear if they're selected, even if there
  are no values for any row
  * This predicates on making sure DataTable.scenarioColumns and
    DataTable.valueColumns are updated accurately
* Add options flag words for the pipeline, and for each individual block
* Add option to ignore or error on a failed float conversion when loading
  the original data (DataTypes.py:128)
* Add option to turn off the cross-product logic for graphs, and just produce
  a single graph
* Purge the graph cache, probably in the plotting code since the slowdown would
  barely be noticable there
* Fix the cache key generation for graphs so it's properly consistent

== Other stuff ==
The filter block probably needs to be more flexible. As a first step it would
be helpful to toggle between "meets all these criteria" and "meets at least
one criteria" - that is between AND and OR relations.
